working
-------
1. web apps lives in mobile browser with webview, without much changes website or webapp works fine in mobiles
we have cordova/phoneGap
2. problem - slower than native apps for heavy apps, webview not provide all options mobile provides

solution
--------
1. create code in out preferred language and compile to native,
2. in our case - we use js engine in mobile and execute js there
3. native controls are mapped to js objects and functions 
4. react native uses jscore under the hood, which is default js engine in ios and safari

react native vs react
---------------------
1. single rendering entry point - start from one root html element
2. unidirectional flow - (props)  data pass from child to parent , not from parent to child
3. re-render on changes 
4. virtual dom - only refresh particular tag if change is need, not entire page
